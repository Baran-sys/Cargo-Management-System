<!--This README is formatted with GitHub Flavored Markdown.-->Cargo Management SystemA simple, console-based application for managing cargo shipments. This project is written entirely in Java and uses a local text file (Kargo.txt) for data persistence.Table of ContentsAbout the ProjectKey FeaturesGetting StartedPrerequisitesInstallation & UsageHow to Get HelpContributingLicenseAbout the ProjectThis project provides a command-line interface (CLI) to manage a basic cargo logistics system. It is designed as a lightweight, standalone Java application that does not require an external database, making it easy to compile, run, and test.All data is persisted in the Kargo.txt file in the project's root directory.Key FeaturesFile-Based Persistence: Reads and writes all cargo data to Kargo.txt.Cargo Management: Allows users to add, update, and view cargo shipments.Package Tracking: Provides functionality to check the status of a shipment.Console Interface: All operations are handled through simple text commands in the terminal.Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine for development and testing.PrerequisitesYou must have the following software installed to run this project.Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.Git: To clone the repository.Installation & UsageBecause this project does not use a build tool like Maven or Gradle, you will compile and run it directly using the javac and java commands.Clone the repository to your local machine:git clone [https://github.com/Baran-sys/Cargo-Management-System.git](https://github.com/Baran-sys/Cargo-Management-System.git)
Navigate to the project directory:cd Cargo-Management-System
Create a bin directory for the compiled .class files:mkdir bin
Compile the Java source code:This command finds all .java files within the src directory and compiles them into the bin directory.# For macOS/Linux:
javac -d bin $(find src -name "*.java")

# For Windows (PowerShell):
# Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object { javac -d bin $_.FullName }

# Alternatively, if all files are in the root of 'src':
# javac -d bin src/*.java
Run the application:Execute the main class from the root directory, telling Java to use the bin folder as the classpath.(Note: Replace Main with the actual name of your project's main class if it is different.)java -cp bin Main
If your main class is inside a package (e.g., com.cargo), you would run:# java -cp bin com.cargo.Main
The application will start, and you can interact with it through your terminal. The Kargo.txt data file will be read from and written to the root project directory.How to Get HelpIf you encounter any bugs, have feature requests, or need assistance, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.ContributingContributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
